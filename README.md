# Milestone List

#### Write-Up:
###### My final project revolves around the creation of a medication management app using Swift, designed to alleviate the challenges associated with medication adherence. Drawing from personal experiences with a genetic condition and witnessing family members navigate Type 1 Diabetes, I recognize the critical importance of adhering to medication schedules. My app aims to serve as a daily companion, offering users a basic platform to organize their medication regimens effectively. Enabling users to input their medications, set personalized reminders, and visualize their schedules through a calendar feature, are the main goals. By prioritizing simplicity and accessibility, I hope to begin bridging the gap between complex treatment plans and everyday life.
